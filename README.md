# description
a flask app to take a weird picture and then display it to the user

# note
there is no file IO so it should be easy to deploy to heroku...
but for now

`ssh -R 80:localhost:3000 ssh.localhost.run`

will work to share it.

Also I could probably translate the code into js...  but thats no fun
