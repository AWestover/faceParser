      Choose a number of colors for the kmeans algorithm to use, take a picture and await a beautiful transformation.

    <h3>Some things you should note:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>This is not a pro site, and is HIGHLY susceptible to crashing. 
        If you submit 2 picture upload requests it might not process both of them. If it crashes please contact me.</li>
      <li>I do not store these images anywhere. 
        They are transmited to a backend python image processing program that I made as base64 strings
        and passed back to the frontend for display in a like matter with NO file I/O</li>
      <li>Kmeans is a pretty cool algorithm. I cluster the colors in the picture you take and then I recolor the clusters.
        In the clustering I basically search through a 3 dimensional color space (RGB) for points that are "centerpoints" for certain groups of the colors in the picture.
        These points (a color is represented by a 3 dimensional vector, or a point in 3d space) are sequentially updated until they become locally optimal fits to the color data's midpoints.</li>
